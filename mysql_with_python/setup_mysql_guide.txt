### Steps to Set Up MySQL and Connect Using Python:

1. **Install MySQL:**
   - For **Ubuntu**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install mysql-server
     ```
   - For **Windows**:
     - Download the installer from the [MySQL official website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).
     - Follow the installation instructions.

2. **Start MySQL Server:**
   - For **Ubuntu**:
     ```bash
     sudo service mysql start
     ```
   - For **Windows**:
     - Start the MySQL service from the Services management console or use the command prompt:
     ```bash
     net start mysql
     ```

3. **Create a Database:**
   - Use the MySQL command line or a GUI tool like MySQL Workbench to create a new database. For example:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
     ```

4. **Create a User and Grant Permissions:**
   - Create a new user and grant them permissions to the database:
     ```sql
     CREATE USER 'myuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mydatabase.* TO 'myuser'@'localhost';
     FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
     ```

5. **Install mysql-connector-python:**
   - Ensure that the `mysql-connector-python` package is installed in your virtual environment:
     ```bash
     pip install mysql-connector-python
     ```

6. **Connect to MySQL Using Python:**
   - Use the following example code in your Python script to connect to the MySQL database:
   ```python
   import mysql.connector as mysql

   # Establish a connection to the database
   connection = mysql.connect(
       host='localhost',
       user='myuser',
       password='mypassword',
       database='mydatabase'
   )

   # Check if the connection was successful
   if connection.is_connected():
       print("Successfully connected to the database")
       connection.close()
   else:
       print("Connection failed")
   ```

### Follow-Up Steps:
- Follow the above steps to set up MySQL and connect to it using the provided Python code.
"""
one liner to enter database as root and create database named prospa
>> mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE prospa; USE prospa; SOURCE database.sql;"
this command will create a database named prospa using the command CREATE DATABASAE prospa
with the schema written in SOURCE database.sql, it uses the database user( -u) as root with a password enter when prompted
because of the -p flag
